This is what I finally submitted to the course 'HTML and CSS in depth' made by Meta and provided by Coursera.
The point of this project was to build a website from scratch with nothing but HTML and CSS, and to make sure to use header, footer, main, navigation bar, flexbox or gridbox, and of course to make the website interactive and aesthetic.
Since we were only allowed to have one HTML-file and one CSS-file in the submission, I decided to make a nice one-page design with content that would slide horizontally in and out of view for the user.

The project was submitted on the 12th of January 2024, and was peer-reviewed and graded 24/26 points :)
