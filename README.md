This is what I finally submitted to the course 'HTML and CSS in depth' made by Meta and provided by Coursera.
The point of this project was to build a website from scratch with nothing but HTML and CSS, and to make sure to use header, footer, main, navigation bar, flexbox or gridbox, and of course to make the website interactive and aesthetic.
Since we were only allowed to have one html file and one css file in the submission, I decided to make a nice one-page design with content that would horizontally to right like a slideshow presentation when clicking on the buttons in the navigation bar. The header and footer I wanted to be fixed, so only the main content would slide in our out of view.
